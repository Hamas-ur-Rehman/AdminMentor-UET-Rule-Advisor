The department andlor college concerned shall no later than six weeks prior to the end of the third year make a decision-favorable or not favorable-with respect to the performance of the faculty member during the time served. A recommendation upon this decision shall be sent immediately by the Dean of the Faculty to the Vice Chancellor of the University who in turn shall at this time make the final decision with respect only to the faculty member's performance, and shall so notify the faculty member no later than two weeks prior to the end of the third year If this decision by the Vice Chancellor about performance is favorable_ the faculty member shall be notified that he or she will receive a second three-year appointment if the University's need for flexibility permits.

If the University's need for flexibility requires that a faculty member judged worthy of retention not be retained, the Vice Chancellor must explain to the Faculty Development;, Evaluation and Recruitment Committee of the concerned Faculty why there is a need for flexibility regarding this particular position; and show that the administration's plans for the academic and fiscal nature of that position are reasonable.

If the Vice Chancellor decides that the University's need for flexibility requires that the faculty position in question must be eliminated, shifted within the department, or shifted to another department or Faculty, andlor if the Vice Chancellor determines that because the percentage of tenured positions (or & combination of tenured and probationary positions) in the department is so high as to make it unwise to authorize an additional probationary appointment, the Dean of the concerned Faculty, respective Department Chairperson and faculty member concerned shall be notified as early in the third year as possible. A faculty member whose performance shows excellence or promise of excellence but whose employment  will not be continued because a position is being eliminated shifted within a department or to another department or Faculty will be offered a notice contract for one additional year of employment beyond the initial three-year appointment

Promotion of such a faculty member, as well as any faculty member granted a second, three-year, probationary appointment, shall be decided according to the (II).
