Service
(a) An indication of service sometimes appears in biographical records that are to be submitted by each faculty member at the end of each year of service: This, however, may not be the case because degrees of modesty vary:
(b) In the case of new appointments, one must depend primarily upon the information obtained from letters of recommendation or other such sources
