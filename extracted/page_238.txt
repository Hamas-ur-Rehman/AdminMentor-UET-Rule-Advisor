Subject:
CLARIEICATION RESIGNATION /QUTTIGSERVICE AFTER A PERSON QPTED FOR TENURE TRACK SYSTEM
The faculty members working under TTS are strongly discouraged to resign from TTS_
Nevertheless, the existing faculty after joining on TTS can join back on the   respective substantive post only if the Tenure appointment is not approved after final review, If, in the mean time, a faculty member decides to resign from his/her Tenure Track position, slhe will have no right of absorption back in the University.
If an "existing faculty member" (who has been transferred from BPS to TTS) reverts back to BPS due to unsatisfactory performance under TTS, helshe will not be allowed to rejoin TTS. An "existing faculty member" while on TTS cannot revert back to BPS on his/her own accord_ Moreover, if a faculty member on tenure track chooses to apply against an advertised TTSIBPS position (before completing his/her tracklprobation period) in the same university, helshe would be required to resign from the university service before applying for the higher positions. The relaxation given to existing faculty members (transferred to TTS from BPS) to retain their lien with the BPS positions will be allowed only once during the entire career cctica ovcrncr
